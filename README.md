### Startup idea for aiding local small businesses in marketing directly to customers

This Android application, written in Java, uses Firebase Firestore to host small business information. Application users can save businesses for quick access or mark as a favorite in order to receive push notifications from that business. Business owners can issue push notifications to notify of sales events or award special offers to customers who select their business. Business owners can indicate promotions, such as sales events, through an icon that appears with their business in the RecyclerView to notify all users of the promotion. Filtering options allow users to search specific types of businesses.

Developed as a startup proof-of-concept in March of 2020
